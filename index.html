        <h3>Pinnacle Global Corp</h3>
        <p>Creating Pinnacle Global was an exercise in elegance and corporate professionalism. I aimed for a premium, executive
        feel that aligned with consulting and global business services. The challenge was designing a layout that looked
        high-end without being too heavy—balancing gradients, white space, iconography, and long sections of content. Ensuring
        readability and hierarchy across multiple service and about sections was another hurdle, especially on mobile. But
        through refining the grid structure, modernizing the hero, and polishing the brand style, the final result was a clean,
        authoritative corporate website. It ended up capturing exactly the level of professionalism I wanted.</p>

        <h3>Project Two</h3>
        <p>Working on this project reminded me that building a brand-new gaming PC is easy—breathing life into an old, outdated
        system is where the real challenge begins. I was called out to clean a client’s PC and hopefully get it running again,
        but the machine wouldn not even power on. After a full diagnostic, I traced the issue back to a failing hard drive.
        Because the hardware was so outdated, repairing it wasn not the most practical solution. Instead of letting a perfectly
        functional system go to waste, I presented my client with an alternative: transforming the old PC into a compact TV box
        or entertainment center. This approach not only saved the device from being discarded but also turned it into something
        genuinely useful. It was a great reminder that creativity and problem-solving often matter more than simply replacing
        parts.</p>

        <h3>TransFlow</h3>
        <p>Building TransFlow Logistics was my first major step into designing a full-scale business website. I set out to create a
        clean, modern platform that felt as reliable as the logistics company it represented. The biggest challenge was
        structuring a large amount of content—services, tracking, quotes, testimonials—while still keeping the design simple and
        intuitive. Tailwind design consistency, mobile navigation, and component organization made the project demanding, but
        each hurdle pushed me to refine my structure and improve my CSS logic. In the end, the site became a polished,
        professional logistics platform that I am proud of—functional, scalable, and visually strong.</p>

        <h3>Project Four</h3>
        <p>Professional Laptop Repair: HP Display Failure Diagnosis & Resolution
        
          This HP laptop was entrusted to me presenting a critical display failure—no output on both the integrated LCD panel
          and external monitors via HDMI/DisplayPort. Initial diagnostics indicated potential GPU failure, however further
          circuit-level analysis revealed the root cause: a voltage discontinuity in the VRAM power delivery circuit.
        
          Using a digital multimeter and thermal imaging, I traced the fault to a compromised power rail feeding the video
          memory subsystem. The issue stemmed from either a col</p>

        <h3>Tech Nova</h3>
        <p>TechNova was where I truly tested my creativity. I wanted a futuristic, tech-forward design with gradients, animations,
        and a clean dark-theme UI that felt like a real cloud-infrastructure company. The challenge was balancing aesthetics
        with performance—especially with animations, grids, and responsiveness. Crafting the services, pricing, and technology
        sections required attention to detail, and the mobile navigation brought its own set of bugs. But after iterating,
        fixing rendering issues, and optimizing interactions, TechNova became a stunning, modern website that showcases both
        design and technical capability. It is one of the projects that pushed my UI/UX skills to a new level.</p>

        <h3>GlobalFLow</h3>
        <p>I created a comprehensive logistics and supply chain management website that serves as a complete digital platform for
        freight forwarding and shipping services. The site needed to convey reliability, global reach, and operational
        efficiency while providing practical tools for customers to interact with the business.</p>
